    content: `Fiona Apple has never been afraid to speak her mind. 

1999’s dramatic masterwork <i>When the Pawn…</i> raised a fist against misogynistic media while 2012’s anti-romantic <i>The Idler Wheel…</i>  revealed the harsh truths of love. But on <i>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</i>, she becomes miraculously lucid in the cyclone of sound she’s created, letting her mind speak for itself.

The first two songs of <i>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</i> play out like a warning of the oncoming storm. Album opener “I Want You to Love Me” begins placidly enough, pairing an airy piano line with Apple’s delicate acceptance of her life’s path. On the second verse she kicks up a breeze, letting her voice become coarse to match the timbre of the string bass, and by the end of the song she’s chirping like a dolphin, in complete control of the cacophony surrounding her. 

Following song “Shameika” snatches up the chorus melody of “I Want You to Love Me” and whips it into a rhythmic force of nature, careening its way through Apple’s origin story with a tirade of triplets. The cadence she describes hearing in her head (“I used to walk down the streets/On my way to school/Grinding my teeth to a rhythm invisible”) soon becomes tangible in the album’s percussive backbone, while the song’s repeated refrain (“Shameika said I had potential”) sets up the record’s reliance on sweeping mantras.

The triumphant title song “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” proves the effectiveness of this combination, functioning as a thesis statement for the album. The clinks and clunks of homemade percussion (including a metal butterfly Apple found in a schoolyard) along with the ambient splashes of an absent-minded vibraphone form a loose and organic structure, which strips the song to its bare essence. Apple’s lyrics share this barebones aesthetic, exchanging <i>The Idler Wheel</i>’s flowery prose for something much more direct, crafting natural-sounding lines while maintaining her clever wordplay: “And I don’t want a war with you, I won’t afford it/You get sore, even when you win.” She’s able to cast off everything that holds her back from being her true self, refusing to let the judgy “it girls”, the cruel “cool kids”, or the controlling media get to her any longer. While on <i>The Idler Wheel</i> she seemed resigned to live with her entrapments, lamenting, “I’m a tulip in a cup/ I stand no chance of growing up,” here she’s ready to break free, proclaiming, “Fetch the bolt cutters.”

Apple exhibits this newfound resoluteness in the fiery anthem “Under the Table”, climbing on the back of a bellowing string bass and chanting at the top of her lungs, “I would beg to disagree but begging disagrees with me.” “Relay” is even more incendiary, lifting a dark insight from Apple’s 15-year-old journal (“Evil is a relay sport/When the one who’s burned/Turns to pass the torch”) to form its lurching chorus. The verses are climactic builds of hand-claps, hums and drums that accentuate Apple’s snarls and yelps at conceited men and self-loving influencers. 

Apple ditches the pitchfork and becomes protective on “Newspaper”, trying to prevent another woman from falling under the spell of a manipulative ex-lover. “I’m alone on the summit now,” she cries, unable to cut through the fog of the man’s lies. Her feelings of isolation echo the difficulties women face when trying to share their hardships, while explaining her fear that she can’t help them. After the song ends in an avalanche of cascading synthetic cymbals and neurotically-plucked guitar, this theme is carried into the more laid-back “Ladies”.

As the most accessible and welcoming song on the album, it provides a comfortable space for Apple to promote the unification of women against men trying to divide them. Despite the cheery and celebratory nature of the song, it ends on a surprisingly dark note. “Yet another woman to whom I won’t get through” she mutters as the instruments cut out one-by-one. 

Fiona Apple hides the album’s darkest subject matter behind a cleverly shifting song structure on “For Her”. With just the power of her voice and a rickety drumset, she nimbly hops across buoyantly joyous musical backdrops while narrating the story of a woman fed up with a man’s bullshit. After the song shifts tone once more, Apple delivers the most crushing blow she’s ever dealt. “Well good morning,” she growls, “Good morning/ You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in.” The song’s rhythmic facade collapses and freezes over with the chilling ghosts of Apple’s voices that point an icy finger at the culprit: “You were so high.”

Apple takes the time on “Drumset” to thaw her tone under its beachy groove, documenting a funny misunderstanding. She recounts verbatim a voice message recorded following an altercation between her and her bandmates, in which she mistook them taking a drumset from her house as an act of defiance. Near the end of the song her dog Mercy jumps up and licks her face, causing her to laugh through the lines, “Why did you not want to try?/ Why did you take it all away?” Such imperfections are scattered throughout the album, often arriving at the end of songs. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” disintegrates into an ambient jazz collage of fluttering bass, resonating vibraphone, and barking dogs. “Relay” ends with Apple’s distant acapella, which sounds like we stumbled upon her singing to herself in the mirror. These frayed ends tie us into Fiona Apple’s world, allowing a peek through open curtains into her life.

Apple ends the album with “On I Go,” a relentless march that vocalizes how the rhythm in her head is heard, keeping her ticking above all else. Her chant transfers the rhythm to us, and leaves us with a message we all need in quarantine: “On I go, not toward or away/Up until now it was day, next day/Up until now in a rush to prove/But now I only move to move.”

Amidst the percussive clutter of Apple’s mind, she’s able to find something that perhaps eluded her previously: clarity. She no longer needs the lush orchestration of <i>When the Pawn…</i> or the poetic complexity of <i>The Idler Wheel</i>. All she needs is a pair of bolt cutters.`,
