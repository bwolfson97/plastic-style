    content: `This is a serious problem I’m not joking. Every time I pull out my laptop and try to write (which is definitely every day because I definitely am a very productive individual) I inevitably hear the trademark electronic gurgles that set up Smashing Pumpkins’ second best song “1979.” &nbsp;I may not know how my finger landed on the play button but I certainly can’t prevent it once it starts -- the slicked-down mid-90’s indie rock strums are so very irresistible. I blame Ben for issuing an ultimatum at the record store I work at: he would either leave or I would play Corgin’s spiritual successor to Sonic Youth’s “Teenage Riot.” It’d been bouncin’ around the ol’ brain for the past few days as a result of its baffling inclusion on my work’s “60’s And 70’s Popular Rock” playlist, so I had no problem relenting to Ben’s demand.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Pumpkins’ ode to fading youth soundtracked my life nonstop for the following week, but that was only the beginning. Before long my addiction extended to all of the tracks on <em>Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> — I played "Tonight, Tonight" about twenty times to dramatize my trips to the laundromat, and I couldn’t stop binging the record’s unimpeachable row of ballads that populate the second half. How am I supposed to write when I could instead succumb to the sweet drawl of “Lily My One and Only” or get swept up in the psychedelic tide of “Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans?”\n\nI let myself get captured by the siren songs of <em>Melon Collie</em> because I like to follow the implicit advice of “1979” and enjoy the rush while it lasts. When you come across an album you just can't peel your ears away from, lean into it. Because after all, one day we'll all turn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dust</a> I guess.`,
