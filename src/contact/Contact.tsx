        Plastic Style was created with the intent of forming an experimental approach to music journalism. With our
        curation of up-and-coming independent artists, we hope to offer a new lens for those looking to explore while
        building a diverse community of fans along the way. Originally started as a podcast, Plastic Style became a blog
        in the summer of 2021.
